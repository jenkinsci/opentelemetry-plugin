# Traces of Jobs and Pipeline Builds


## Traces and Spans Attributes

The Jenkins OpenTelemetry integration collects comprehensive contextual attributes of the jobs and pipelines builds to: 
* Provide build executions details in order to be an alternative to the Jenkins GUI if desired
* Enable troubleshooting CI problems slicing and dicing in any dimension
* Offer traceability and audit on CI/CD as part of the Software Lifecycle process integrity (see [Introducing SLSA, an End-to-End Framework for Supply Chain Integrity](https://security.googleblog.com/2021/06/introducing-slsa-end-to-end-framework.html)...)

The attributes of the traces and spans are normalized in order

### Pipeline step spans

Attributes reported on the span of pipeline steps:

| Status Code | Status Description | Description |
|-------------|--------------------|-------------|
| OK | | for step and build success |
| UNSET | Machine readable status like `FlowInterruptedException:FailFastCause:Failed in branch failingBranch` | For interrupted steps of type fail fast parallel pipeline interruption, pipeline build superseded by a newer build, or pipeline build cancelled by user, the span status is set to `UNSET`  rather than `ERROR` for readability |
| ERROR | Machine readable status like `FlowInterruptedException:ExceededTimeout:Timeout has been exceeded` | For other causes of step failure |

| Attribute                        | Description  | Type |

### Environment variables for trace context propagation and integrations

The trace context is exposed as environment variables in shell/bat/powershell steps to ease integration with third party tools.

* `TRACEPARENT`: the [W3C Trace Context header `traceparent`](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context-1/#traceparent-header)
* `TRACESTATE`: the [W3C Trace Context header `tracestate`](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context-1/#tracestate-header)
* `TRACE_ID`: the trace id of the job / pipeline build
* `SPAN_ID`: the id of the pipeline shell/bat/powershell step span

When the configuration options "Export OpenTelemetry configuration as environment variables", the following [OpenTelemetry environment variables](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/v1.6.0/specification/protocol/exporter.md) will be exported according to the settings of the plugin to enable configuring downstream OpenTelemetry aware CI/CD tools:

* `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`: Target to which the exporter is going to send spans or metrics.
* `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_INSECURE`: Whether to enable client transport security for the exporter's gRPC connection.
* `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`: Key-value pairs to be used as headers associated with gRPC or HTTP requests. Usually used to pass credentials.
* `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TIMEOUT`: Maximum time the OTLP exporter will wait for each batch export.
* `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_CERTIFICATE`: The trusted certificate to use when verifying a server's TLS credentials.

In addition, if the backends were configured then there will be an environment variable for each of them pointing to the URL with the span/transactions:

* `OTEL_CUSTOM_URL`
* `OTEL_ELASTIC_URL`
* `OTEL_JAEGER_URL`
* `OTEL_ZIPKIN_URL`
