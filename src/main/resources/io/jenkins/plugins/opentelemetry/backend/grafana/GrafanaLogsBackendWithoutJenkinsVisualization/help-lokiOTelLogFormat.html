    Before version 3.0, Loki was storing OpenTelemetry logs as JSON messages including the log body, the log fields
    (spanID, traceID, severity...), the log attributes, and the resource attributes.<br/>
    Starting from version 3.0, Loki stores OpenTelemetry logs sent to its native OTLP endpoint using labels and
    structured metadata for the log fields, attributes, and resource attributes (more details <a
    href="https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/send-data/otel/">in Loki OpenTelemetry docs</a> ).<br/>
    Indicate the format of the logs stored in Loki to adapt the LogQL queries generated by the Jenkins OpenTelemetry
    plugin.
